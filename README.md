# KolsLeetSolutions
In a sentence, this repository is a collection of my LeetCode solutions. My goal for this repository is to document my progress through NeetCode.io's Data Structures and Algorithms Roadmap (https://neetcode.io/roadmap). By progressing through this structured list of LeetCode problems I hope to strengthen my programming fundamentals and prepare for technical interviews. As far as some of the standards of this repo: I will post the prompt, an explanation of my solution, my code solution to the prompt, and finally a description of the relative efficiency of said solution. Since the primary goal of this repository is to become a stronger programmer I will at least be posting my FIRST accepted solution regardless of efficiency, in order to document improvement. If I have time on that given day, I will digest the problem more thoroughly, post multiple solutions and explain the spectrum of efficiency for the problem. "Why?" you may be asking, because programming puzzles are like candy, and if I am in a rush to leave grandma's house, I will bite down on the butterscotch, but it ought to be savored.
